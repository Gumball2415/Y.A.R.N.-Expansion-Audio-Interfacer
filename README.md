# Y.A.R.N. Expansion Audio Interfacer

![](docs/YARN.png)

An Open-Source HardWare (OSHW) Famicom single expansion audio interfacer.

## About

This project aims to allow a host cartridge to control an expansion audio cartridge's sound chip through selected audio registers. This is a child of the S.C.A.R.F. project.

The principle is that the Main cartridge is expected to contain everything the NSF or program needs, with the audio solely being handled by the Exp audio cartridge.

This means that the expansion audio cartridge is write-only.

## Use

The Main cartridge is expected to contain mapper hardware that the NSF or program needs.

The Console is expected to not read the Exp. cartridge, but instead to write to registers the Exp. cartridge is expected to contain.

The Exp. cartridge must contain hardware that generates audio accessible by write-only registers that the Console expects.

If the Exp. cartridge contains VRC6B, toggle SW2 accordingly.

Do not toggle SW1, it is for prototyping purposes.

For Everdrives and flash carts: The flash cart UI (if it has one) may cause unwanted side effects if it is connected to YARN.
